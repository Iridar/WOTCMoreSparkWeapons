;	This mod adds some new Arm Cannon animations to fire Spark Heavy Weapons.
;	By default they are used only if the Heavy Weapon is equipped in the Auxiliary Weapon Slot.
;	Or if the SPARK doesn't have a BIT equipped.
;	If this is "true", SPARKs will use the new Arm Cannon animations for all equipped Heavy Weapons,
;	even if the BIT is equipped. Cosmetic difference only.

;	With this mod, character templates configured above
;	will lose their natural Heavy Weapon Slot, and will regain it only if they have a 
;	a Secondary Weapon with a weapon category configured below.
